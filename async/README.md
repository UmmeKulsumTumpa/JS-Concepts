# Synchronous vs Asynchronous JavaScript

## Synchronous

Synchronous programming means the code runs in a specific sequence of instructions as given in the program. Each instruction waits for the previous one to complete its execution before moving on to the next. This can sometimes lead to blocking, where important tasks wait for others to finish.

**Code Example:**

```bash
console.log('First');
console.log('Second');
console.log('Third');
```

**Output:**

```bash
First
Second
Third
```

## Asynchronous

Asynchronous programming allows code execution to continue immediately to the next instruction without waiting for previous instructions to complete, thus preventing delays in the user interface. This approach utilizes mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and async-await to manage tasks that take time, such as network requests or timeouts.

**Code Example:**

```bash
console.log('First');

// Set timeout for 2 seconds
setTimeout(() => console.log('Second'), 2000);

console.log('Third');
```

**Output:**

```bash
First
Third
Second
```

Asynchronous code execution improves performance and responsiveness, making it essential for handling time-consuming tasks without blocking the main thread.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Call Stacks**: The mechanism that manages function execution.
- **Web APIs**: Browser-provided features that handle asynchronous tasks.
- **Callback Queue**: A queue that holds callback functions waiting to be executed.
- **Event Loop**: A process that continuously checks the call stack and callback queue, allowing asynchronous code to run correctly.
